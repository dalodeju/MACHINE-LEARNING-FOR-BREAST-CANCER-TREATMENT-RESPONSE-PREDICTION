# Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Treatment Response Prediction

This project aims to predict the response to breast cancer treatment using machine learning techniques. The goal is to preprocess and prepare the dataset for model training by handling missing values, removing outliers, and scaling features. The ultimate aim is to build models that can classify treatment response and predict relapse-free survival (RFS) based on various medical and genetic features.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas scipy xlrd
```

## Preprocessing Steps

### 1. **Loading the Dataset**

The dataset is loaded using `pandas.read_excel()` from an Excel file (`TrainDataset2024.xls`). The dataset contains both features and target columns. The target columns include the outcomes for classification (`pCR`) and regression (`RelapseFreeSurvival`), while the features are used for training the models.

### 2. **Handling Missing Data**

- **Categorical Columns**: Missing values in categorical columns (e.g., strings or labels) are imputed using the **mode** (most frequent value) with `SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')`.
- **Numerical Columns**: Missing values in numerical columns (e.g., integers or floats) are imputed using the **mean** with `SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')`.

### 3. **Outlier Detection and Removal**

Outliers in numerical columns are detected using the **Z-score** method. A Z-score greater than 3 (in absolute value) indicates an outlier. These rows are removed from the dataset to ensure that the model is not biased by extreme values.

### 4. **Feature Scaling**

Feature scaling is an essential step in preprocessing, especially when the dataset contains numerical features with varying scales. Standardizing the features ensures that all numerical features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can improve the performance and convergence speed of many machine learning algorithms.

**StandardScaler** is used from `scikit-learn` to scale the numerical features. The `fit_transform()` method is used to scale the cleaned data (`X_clean`).

### 5. **Label Encoding**

Label encoding is used to convert categorical variables into numerical format. Many machine learning algorithms expect input features to be numeric, and label encoding helps by assigning a unique integer to each category in a categorical feature.

**LabelEncoder** is used from `scikit-learn` to encode categorical features such as **ER**, **HER2**, and **Gene**. Label encoding works by assigning each unique category in the column an integer value.

### 6. **Saving the Preprocessed Data**

Once all preprocessing steps are completed, it's essential to save the processed data for future use in model training. The data will be stored in a **DataFrame** format, where:
- The features are scaled and encoded as required.
- The target variables (**pCR** and **RelapseFreeSurvival**) are also included in the final dataset.

## **Feature Selection**
In this section, we will explore techniques to identify and select the most important features that contribute to the prediction of the target variables (**pCR** and **RelapseFreeSurvival**). Feature selection helps improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model by removing irrelevant or redundant features.

## **Classification (for pCR prediction)**
This section will cover how to apply machine learning classification techniques to predict the **pCR (pathologic complete response)** outcome. We will explore various classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## **Regression (for Relapse-Free Survival prediction)**
In this section, we will implement regression algorithms to predict **Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)**, a continuous variable. We will evaluate different regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## **Model Evaluation**
Model evaluation is crucial to assess the performance of the classification and regression models. In this section, we will use appropriate evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for classification tasks, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared for regression tasks.

## **Model Tuning**
To improve the performance of the models, we will explore hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search to find the optimal settings for the machine learning algorithms.

## **Conclusion**
In the conclusion, we will summarize the findings from the models, reflect on their performance, and provide recommendations for further research or improvements.
